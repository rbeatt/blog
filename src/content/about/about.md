Hi, I’m **Ryan Beattie**, a software engineer from Belfast who enjoys building things that make life a little easier and a little smarter.

I spend most of my time exploring how software, cloud systems, and AI can work together to solve real problems. I like clean design, thoughtful engineering, and learning something new every day.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me tinkering with new ideas, helping others get started in tech, or writing about what I’ve learnt along the way.

Thanks for stopping by. This space is where I share thoughts, experiments, and reflections on the journey.

You can reach me at **hello@ryanbeattie.dev** or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanbeatt) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rbeatt).
