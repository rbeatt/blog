Hi, I’m **Ryan Beattie**, a software engineer from Belfast.  

This blog covers projects I work on outside of work, exploring software, cloud systems, and AI, and the insights I gain along the way. I enjoy tackling challenges that push me to learn, experiment, and improve the way things work.  

Thanks for visiting. You can reach me at **hello@ryanbeattie.dev** or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanbeatt) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rbeatt).
